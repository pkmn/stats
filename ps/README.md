# ps

This package provides a shim around the encapsulated Pokemon-Showdown project, exposing
the minimal required API and providing type information for use in Typescript. This package
is meant to be a temporary solution, to be replaced with a `core` Pokemon-Showdown package
instead: [pkmn.cc/modular-ps][1] and [pkmn.cc/ps-core-design][2].
